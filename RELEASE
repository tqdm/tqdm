HOW TO MANAGE A NEW RELEASE
===========================

This file is intended for the project's maintainers and it describes
how to update, build and upload a new release.

Most of the management commands have been directly placed inside
the Makefile, so you just have to run `make [alias]`.

Note: to use the Makefile on Windows, you need to install make.exe,
for example by installing [MinGW MSYS](http://www.mingw.org/wiki/msys).


SEMANTIC VERSIONING
-------------------

The tqdm repository managers should regularly bump the version number in the
VERSION file to follow the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/)
convention.

Tools can be used to automate this process, such as
[bumpversion](https://github.com/peritus/bumpversion) or
[python-semanticversion](https://github.com/rbarrois/python-semanticversion/)
to automate this task.

The managers should take care of this instead of users to avoid PR conflicts
solely due to the VERSION file bumping.


CHECKING SETUP.PY
-----------------

To check that the setup.py is OK for PyPi (eg, version number,
reStructuredText in README.rst intelligible for PyPi, which uses a
awkward RST lib, etc.) you can use the following command to make
sure everything's ok:

```
python setup.py check --restructuredtext --strict
```

Also, if you happen to mistakenly upload a broken release to PyPi,
you can fix the metadata by using: `make pypimeta` or `python setup.py register`


BUILDING A RELEASE AND UPLOADING TO PYPI
----------------------------------------

First, check `setup.py` and `MANIFEST.in`, which define the packaging
process and info that will be uploaded to [pypi](pypi.python.org).

Check the result by using the following commands:

```
make installdev
```

Secondly, build tqdm into a distributable python package:

```
make build
```

This will generate several builds in the `dist/` folder.

Finally, we can upload everything to pypi. Uploading to pypi can be done
easily using the [twine](https://github.com/pypa/twine) module:

```
make pypi
```

NOTE:

- you can also test on the pypi test servers `testpypi.python.org/pypi`
before the real deployment
- in case of a mistake, you can delete an uploaded release on pypi, but you
cannot re-upload another with the same version number!
- in case of a mistake in the metadata on pypi (like the long description README
getting garbled because of a silent error), you can use the following
command to update the metadata: `make pypimeta` or `python setup.py register`

Also, the new release can be added to the Github by creating a new release
from the web interface.
